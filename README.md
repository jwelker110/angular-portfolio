## Adjusting the colors
1. Colors are stored in _styles/\_colors.scss_. Change the value of _$theme-highlight-color to change the 
project-wide_ color.
2. A "Dark Theme" has been included as well, and is disabled by default. To enable it, open 
_styles/\_variables.scss_ and uncomment `//@import "themes/dark";`
3. The colors provided consist of a "dark", "neutral", and "light" variant for most of them. Use "light"
colors in combination with the "Dark Theme" and "dark" colors with the default theme. Neutral colors tend
to look fine paired with either theme.
